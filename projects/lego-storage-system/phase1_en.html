<p>For a few years now, I’ve been selling LEGO pieces online, and I’ve needed to effectively organize and store my inventory. Over the years, I’ve designed and built a custom storage solution. In this article, I reflect on this adventure.</p>

<h2 id="wooden-boxes">Wooden boxes</h2>

<p>There’s a makerspace near my home equipped with a laser cutter. After a training session, I started experimenting with this machine and quickly realized its potential for making wooden boxes to store my LEGO pieces.</p>

<p>Initially, I wanted to create boxes that were as thin as possible to maximize the available space for the pieces. After a first prototype made from 1mm poplar plywood scraps I found at a modeling shop, I settled on using 3mm plywood. The compromise between sturdiness and volume was satisfactory, and it was a material that was easy to find in nearby hardware stores and relatively affordable.</p>

<p>I based the size of the first boxes on the compartments of the storage system I was using at the time, resulting in a square box measuring 75mm on each side. A box with these dimensions can hold an 8-stud-long LEGO piece with just the right amount of margin.</p>

<p>For the height, I wanted to respect the ratio of LEGO bricks, considering that my box was equivalent to a 2x2 brick. LEGO brick experts know that 2 LEGO units correspond to 5 plate heights, and a brick is 3 plates high. For a 75mm square box, the height comes to 75*3/5 = 45mm. I found that too tall, so I reduced it to 2 plates instead of 3, making it 30mm. I think this is the perfect ratio.</p>

<p>From there, assuming my base box is 2x2 units wide and 2 plates high, I experimented with a variety of sizes in 1x1, 1x2, 2x3, 2x4, 3x3, etc., in heights of 1, 2, 3, or 4 plates. I quickly realized that larger, shorter models are useful as trays to hold pieces during builds. I made larger versions that I am still using today.</p>

</a></p>

</a></p>

<h2 style="clear: both" id="proto-drawers">Proto-drawers</h2>

<p>I started to have a number of loose boxes and felt the need for a higher level of storage. Still using the laser cutter, I began by creating large boxes designed to hold several smaller boxes. This allowed me to play with the modular system and gave me a first glimpse of what a full drawer might look like. It was very encouraging.</p>

<p>I then made stackable sleeves in which the boxes could slide, and added a tab on the front face to create something resembling drawers. I was getting closer to what I had envisioned from the beginning, and it was very exciting.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/projects/lego-storage-system/phase1/11.jpg"><img src="/assets/projects/lego-storage-system/phase1/11.jpg" alt="" width="49%" style="float: left; padding-bottom: 1rem;" />
</a></p>

<p><a href="/assets/projects/lego-storage-system/phase1/10.jpg"><img src="/assets/projects/lego-storage-system/phase1/10.jpg" alt="" width="49%" style="float: right; padding-bottom: 1rem;" />
</a></p>

<h2 style="clear: both" id="real-drawers">Real drawers</h2>

<p>The outcome so far was very encouraging, but I was hitting the limits of what a laser cutter alone can do, and it was time to level up.</p>

<p>I searched for slides to create proper drawers. The feeling of quality when opening and closing the drawers was an important criterion. I wanted my drawers to give a sense of sturdiness and quality, with smooth opening and closing, without tipping as the drawer opens, and without the fear of dislodging the drawer if opened too quickly. I also wanted the drawers to be able to open fully to access even the boxes at the back.</p>

<p>After finding and ordering full-extension metal slides on Amazon, I made a first prototype with 10mm poplar plywood. I cut the pieces with a jigsaw, but the result was very mediocre. Nothing was truly straight, the opening/closing of the drawers was not smooth, and the open drawers collided with each other.</p>

<p>The makerspace that hosts the laser cutter also has a woodshop. After completing the necessary training, I undertook a second prototype, this time using a table saw. The result was much better, and I still use this prototype today, with some minor modifications.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/projects/lego-storage-system/phase1/15.jpg"><img src="/assets/projects/lego-storage-system/phase1/15.jpg" alt="" width="49%" style="float: left; padding-bottom: 1rem;" />
</a></p>

<p><a href="/assets/projects/lego-storage-system/phase1/13.jpg"><img src="/assets/projects/lego-storage-system/phase1/13.jpg" alt="" width="49%" style="float: right; padding-bottom: 1rem;" />
</a></p>

<h2 style="clear: both" id="going-larger">Going larger</h2>

<p>Encouraged by this result, I wanted to step it up by creating a piece of furniture on the same model but twice as wide. It mostly worked well, but the large continuous surface of the drawers causes the bottom to sag under the weight. Because of this, the boxes end up tightly packed together, making access more difficult, and also the drawers rub against each other.</p>

<p>The result was still encouraging, and I still use this prototype today. I also added real handles. I chose a simple yet effective model for discreet, elegant, and functional handles.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/projects/lego-storage-system/phase1/3.jpg"><img src="/assets/projects/lego-storage-system/phase1/3.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>For the next piece of furniture, I kept the same drawer size but increased the number of drawers from 5 to 16. This starts making a good storage unit. To prevent the bottom from sagging, I added a partition that divides the drawer into two parts, helping to support the bottom. I also tested a double-height drawer to store larger pieces.</p>

</a></p>

<h2 id="towards-better-quality">Towards better quality</h2>

<p>So far, the furniture has been very satisfactory, and I still use them daily without major issues. However, I’m not fully satisfied with the aesthetics, particularly the inconsistent spacing between the drawers, with some being a bit crooked. I therefore sought to innovate in manufacturing techniques.</p>

<p>The main issue with previous prototypes was the proper positioning of the slides. Until now, I marked the drill points for the slides by hand, measuring directly on the boards. Having heard that another makerspace, a bit further from my home, had a CNC milling machine, I had the idea of creating grooves with the milling machine to accommodate the slides, thus allowing them to be held in place precisely.</p>

<p>After several experiments to get the hang of the machine and determine the ideal groove dimensions, I created a small piece of furniture to validate the concept. I also used the milling machine to drill the holes for the handles to ensure they were well-aligned. I wanted to achieve the best result possible. To this end, I also replaced the 10mm plywood with 19mm three-ply for a better visual finish.</p>

<p>The result met my expectations. The finish is better than all the furniture made previously. However, machining the grooves takes a lot of machine time, leading to a significant cost. This technique isn’t viable for making a large piece of furniture. So I tried something different. Instead of creating a whole groove, I simply made the drill points with the milling machine. To test this technique, I made a wide piece of furniture, but with only 5 drawers. The result wasn’t as good.</p>

</a></p>

<h2 id="conclusion-and-future-plans">Conclusion and future plans</h2>

<p>This project has been underway for almost 4 years now. I currently have a total of 5 pieces of furniture of varying capacities that I use daily to store my LEGO pieces for my online shop. The modular box system allows me to take out the boxes easily to retrieve pieces and reconfigure the layout in the drawers as needed, which is really enjoyable.</p>

<p>I still need more storage space, and I plan to build more furniture while always looking to improve the design. The positioning of the drawers is still not ideal without blowing the budget in machining time. I have more ideas, like using a template for drilling. I’m also thinking about a way to position the drawer fronts once the drawers are in place. I think this is the simplest way to achieve an overall optimal result without seeking perfection in the positioning of the slides. Also, the current slides don’t allow the drawer to extend beyond its depth, making access to the boxes at the back difficult, especially when there’s a handle from the drawer above right above it. One option would be to find slides that allow for greater than full extension, but I’m not sure if those exist. The simplest solution is to make the  drawers shorter than the slides.</p>

<p>For the next project, I plan to create a set with a capacity equivalent to all 5 pieces of furniture I have today. I’d like to try adding a large illustration that spans the fronts of the drawers. I’m also considering a system of connected drawers with semi-automatic opening controlled by my picking software.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>
