# Redaction

## Pages

Pages must have a title to appear in the menu.


## Posts

By default, posts have a url of the form /{category}/{year}/{month}/{day}/{title},
and partial URLs like for example /{category}/{year} yield a directory listing. 

I do not want that. I use permalink for all posts.
Permalinks conflicts trigger a warning at build time.
